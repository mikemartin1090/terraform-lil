# Learning Terraform
Going through a [Terraform LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-terraform/terraform-initialization?u=2121497).

### Installing Terraform
1. [Download here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
2. Extract binary from Zip
3. Copy both zip and binary in to `~/Terraform`
4. Add this to your `$PATH` via your bash profile (in my case zsh)
```
# Terraform to my PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/mmartin/Terraform
```
